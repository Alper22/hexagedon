 - [ ] set UV map for hexagon meshes.
 - [ ] implement basic AI behavior.
 - [ ] implement in-game menu.

Extra tasks:

 - [ ] implement basic map generation.
 - [ ] draw borders around field groups (ie. good looking field group borders).
 - [ ] implement good map generation.
 - [ ] implement good splash screen shader (eg tron themed).
 - [ ] implement good in-game shaders (eg. tron themed).
 - [ ] ERROR: Condition "!m" is true. Returning: 0 at: mesh_get_surface_count (servers/rendering/dummy/storage/mesh_storage.h:110)

Future tasks:

 - [X] ERROR: Error opening file 'res://icon.svg'. at: load_image (core/io/image_loader.cpp:90)
 - [X] implement click behavior (click on field activates respective field group).
 - [X] implement highlighting of active field group.
 - [X] a field group has several fields.
 - [X] every field is in exactly one field group.
 - [X] extract map generation and use a 2D array as the interface (filed with a number of the field group it belongs to).
